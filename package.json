  "description": "This project demonstrates how to combine a real-time stream of candlestick data from lower timeframes (e.g., 1m) into higher timeframes (e.g., 5m, 15m, 1h) using JavaScript. The project includes a proxy that retrieves candlestick data via a WebSocket connection to Binance and emits real-time data to the client. The client then visualizes the aggregated data on a candlestick chart using the LightweightCharts library, along with corresponding volume data.",
